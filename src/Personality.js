      Corgis originated as working dogs, used to help herd cattle and other livestock. Today, they are mainly family pets, but they still have that working dog spirit of the ancestors.
      Corgis have larger than life personalities packed into their small bodies. Though like with any dog or animal or even humans, their personality will vary from one dog to another, they are mostly very cheerful animals. 
      They love to play and are trusting and quick to offer affection.
